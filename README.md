# Ideas

### *DotDict*
- add MappingProxyType support to DotDict ?
- make DotDict work with any type of key (convert keys to strings) ?
- make a script that returns whether a string can be used at all as a class attribute name ?

### *pretty_string_factory*
- make pretty_string_factory print the class name when it is not a builtin type ?

### *powershell profile*
- add a script to interact with the trashbin ?
    - restore a file from the recycle bin if it is unique, or maybe the last one
    - [empty it completely](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/clear-recyclebin?view=powershell-7.3)
    - open in file explorer
    - [good blog post](https://jdhitsolutions.com/blog/powershell/7024/managing-the-recycle-bin-with-powershell/)

### *Windows*
- add a scheduler task to start the task manager on session start ?

### *other*
- install WSL ?
- make a script to download all listed urls with youtube-dl

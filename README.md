# TODO

- [x] add docstrings to DotDict => make custom docstring template
- [ ] make DotDict.\_\_dict__ behavior consistent with a regular object (not a dict) behavior - **WIP**
- [ ] make every DotDict dict method consistent with the dict class - **WIP**
- [ ] add unit tests for DotDict
- [ ] store touch.py logic in a function
- [ ] make pretty_string_factory a module on its own

# Ideas

- add MappingProxyType support to DotDict ?
- make DotDict work with any type of key (convert keys to strings) ?
- make DotDict.\_\_str__ print the class name when it is not a builtin type ?
